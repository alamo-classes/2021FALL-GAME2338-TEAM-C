Summary
Apex Legends has taken the battle royale genre and crushed it by providing a fast paced fun experience that's open for anyone who's played a first person shooter for the most
part. When usually genres like this are dominated by one clear winner with some big seconds, Apex has nestled itself atop the battle royale mountain with Fortnite and surpassed
Player Unknowns Battlegrounds. Apex has a very easy and intuitive tutorial and allows for a beginner to grasp the controls quickly as well as master them. I think that we agree,
the game is a fun, well rounded experience that has a certain appeal and likability, not only with the characters, but the weapons, graphics, events, and the maps as well. 
The game has a very dedicated staff team to bug fixes and overall gameplay changes as well, meaning it has a lot of support to ensure it is constantly being repaired and 
maintained. We look forward to testing this game and seeing if there are any bugs or where special measures have been taken to make certain no bugs appear in the first place.
