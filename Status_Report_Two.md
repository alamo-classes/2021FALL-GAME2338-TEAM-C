# Current Schedule

The rest of this week is focused on finishing test cases and getting them logged into the github project so we can tweak and wrap up all of our findings in order to finalize the drafts and turn this project in by the end of the semester. 

# Changes

* adding in more of a variety of test cases
* Splitting up original test cases into a more specific category, such as mechanics being split into environment interaction, character interaction, etc. This will make it easier to broaden our search

## Additional tasks to add

* make test cases more specific 
* Test crossplay

## What has been completed and date of completion

test strategies and test cases have been created over thanksgiving break.

# General Notes/Overall Status

We pushed back the due date as we found new ideas on how to better split up our tasks and create more test cases. The time was pushed back so we can give a more thorough test on all of our cases, especially after finding our first issue with buttons in the settings menu of the UI which originally wasnt going to be one of the test cases.
