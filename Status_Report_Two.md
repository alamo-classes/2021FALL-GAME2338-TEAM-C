# Current Schedule

The rest of this week is focused on finishing test cases and getting them logged into our github project so we can tweak and wrap up all of our findings in order to finalize the drafts and turn this project in by the end of the semester. Prefereably we'll have a veritable amount of extensively tested cases and be able to punctually report them in time.
We also plan on going over past reports and learning from what we reported in the past.

# Changes

* Adding in more of a variety of test cases
* Splitting up original test cases into a more specific category, such as mechanics being split into environment interaction, character interaction, etc. This will make it easier to broaden our search
* Building on our past reports and possibly retesting them.

## Additional tasks to add

* Make test cases more specific 
* Test and compare crossplay
* Test in-game UI (Menus, and cohesiveness of health and ammo etc.)

## What has been completed and date of completion

* Testing of different play strategies.
* Test cases have been created over thanksgiving break.
* General gameplay and UI Menus.
* Multiplayer Online Integration and Intuitiveness.

# General Notes/Overall Status

We pushed back the due date as we found new ideas on how to better split up our tasks and create more test cases. The time was pushed back so we can give a more thorough test on all of our cases, especially after finding our first issue with buttons in the settings menu of the UI which originally wasnt going to be one of the test cases.
