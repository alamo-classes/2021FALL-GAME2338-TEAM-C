# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

The project is to test some of the core functions of Apex Legends, such as basic control functionality and how they handle in gameplay, shooting mechanics, progression errors and crashes, and any sort of issues with multiplayer functionality such as crossplay functions as well.

## Environment/User Community

Presumably our testing environment will preside over the PC community

## Test Objectives

Are the core mechanics of the game solid and function well whether on gamepad or keyboard
Are menu options well calibrated and house all thinkable options a player would want
Is the multiplayer functionality very well protected and developed
Is the game overall accessible and fun for all players
Are files well optimized
Is the game fairly crash resistant


## Acceptance Criteria

## Budgets

No budget

## Testing
### Requirements

Since testing will come from us three, no special training should be required as we have been learning about testing for a while now. No software should be required either unless recording is necessary for bug capture.

### Testing Materials/Test Tools

Possible capturing of footage of bugs or errors if reproduceable, and github documentation of bugs and descriptions of said bugs.

### Test Training

Playtest training might be helpful but unnessecary for now.
