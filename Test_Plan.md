# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

The project is to test some of the core functions of Apex Legends, such as basic control functionality and how they handle in gameplay, shooting mechanics, progression errors and crashes, and any sort of issues with multiplayer functionality such as crossplay functions as well.

## Environment/User Community
Testing will be done through PC as well as Playstation.
Testing will be done at our own location as we will use discord as a means
of communication. The group's personal discord server will be a meeting are to compare and contrast notes 
as well as fix any issues we foresee in the testing process.


## Test Objectives

•Usability
    -Are the instructions clear
    -Does the UI help the player
    -Are menu options well calibrated and house all thinkable options a player would want

• Functionality
     -Are the core mechanics of the game solid and function well whether on gamepad or keyboard 
     -Is the multiplayer functionality very well protected and developed
     -Is the game overall accessible and fun for all players
     -Player interaction with map works as intended
     -Are files well optimized
     -Is the game fairly crash resistant
    -Reliability: The button/key functions work consistently
     
• Balance
    -Is loot balanced
    -Is map balanced
    -Does chance play an appropriate role in the game (test by using different strategies, note every first loot object picked up at start of game) 
    -"Perfectly Imbalanced" (imbalances that allow players to grow)
     
    
• Integration
  -The theme and mechanics go well together and reinforce eachother

## Budgets

No budget

## Testing
### Requirements

Since testing will come from us three, no special training should be required as we have been learning about testing for a while now. 
No new software should be required either unless recording is necessary for bug capture.
Basic Requirements needed are a PC and Playstation as well as the game.

### Testing Materials/Test Tools

Discord and github.
Possible capturing of footage of bugs or errors if reproduceable, and github documentation of bugs and descriptions of said bugs.


### Test Training

Playtest training might be helpful but unnessecary for now.

# Section 3: Specifications and Evaluations

## Requirement Specifications

### Business Rules/Functions

character movement WASD/Joystick
Attack-Triggers
interact- E/Triangle

### Software/Game Functions

Possible recording software
Internet Connection 
Apex Legends

### Test/Function Relationships

Match individual tests or test suites to requirements (this is usually a table)
Beginning stages of developing your test suites

| Test  | Relationship |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Start Game | UI buttons |
| Basic Movement | joystick (PS4), WASD (PC)  |
| sprint | L3 (PS4), Shift (PC) |
| Aim/Shoot  | Triggers L1/L2 (PS4), Mouse R/L click (PC)  |
| Interact w/ Items| Swuare (PS4), E (PC) |
| cross platform compatible | connect with players using other devices |
|end game | Disconnect from game|

### Test Progression


## Methods and Constraints

### Test Methodology

Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing, Performance Testing, Endurance Testing, Stress Testing, Compatability Testing, Usability Testing

### Extent of Testing
Testing the functionality and integration in the game as a whole.
Each team member will play multiple games of Apex Legends using different strategies in order to test each function repeatedly.
Using different strategies such as landing destinations, straggling from teammates, or the use of different characters
will help test the balance of the game. Any issues will be recorded.
### Constraints
Time constraints and time management
Internet issues
