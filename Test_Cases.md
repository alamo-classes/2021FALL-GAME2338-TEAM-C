## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (√) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Open the application | Game loads | (√) |			
| 2 | navigate the menu | button functions should select | (√) |			
| 3 | press options on controller| options/settings should appear | (√) |			
| 4 | adjust options such as resolution/audio | program should keep the options throughout play | (√) |			
| 5 | press back button| pressing the button should allow you to go back | (x) |			
| 6 | pressing suggested keys/buttons work | any buttons shown do as intended | (√) |			
| 7 | press play | the game should start | (√) |			
	

## Overall Test Status:
The game is easily navigateable through the use of the correct buttons as shown. Most buttons navigate to the correlating areas, however, on the settings page (PS4), you can hover over the buttons (back, return to main menu, and view cinematic) but clicking the buttons does nothing but fire the select sound and highlight the button. They do have the the correct symbols for the buttons to press so clicking the direction buttons on controller funtion as intended. UPDATE: I tested the same menu on my pc and it seemed to work, showing that the settings screen buttons were intended to function on the ps4 but something went wrong. In my experience it's a simple variable that isnt correctly referenced and would be an easy fix.
